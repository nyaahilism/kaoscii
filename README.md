# WELCOME
are you a fan of text art or japanese emoticon faces (a.k.a. kaomoji)? 

If so, you've come to the right place!<br>
I've got loads & loads of stuff saved up from over the years all here in these text files!

Neat right? Well here's the kicker!<br>
It's all free for anyone to use!  So just have a looksee & copy to your hearts content!

If you enjoy them as much as me, go ahead & like!
